ctms-commons
============

This project is a collection of libraries for shared functionality
across the CTMS workspace, and particularly among the applications in
the Clinical Trials Suite.

Using
-----

ctms-commons is distributed on the [NCI CBIIT public ivy
repository][cbiit-ivy].  The organization is `gov.nih.nci.cabig.ctms`.

It has dependencies from the public caGrid 1.2, SpringSource, and
central Maven 2 repositories.  See `ivy/ivysettings.xml` for URLs and
patterns.

Development
-----------

### Changes

No commits that affect the public API may be made without an
associated entry in the changelog.

### Building

This library is built with buildr.  As of this writing, it works with
buildr 1.4.6 on jruby 1.6.2.  It uses ivy4r for ivy integration.

To set up a new development environment, install jruby and then use
jruby to run `install_gems.rb` in the root of the project.

#### CI

The CI build is at https://ctms-ci.nubic.northwestern.edu/hudson/job/ctms-commons/ .

Javadoc snapshots are at https://ctms-ci.nubic.northwestern.edu/hudson/job/ctms-commons%20javadoc/javadoc/ .

### Testing

#### Databases

The suite-authorization module has integrated tests that are either
PostgreSQL or Oracle-backed.  In order to run these tests,
successfully, you'll need to

1) Create a database for them to use
2) Create a properties file in `build/` pointing to the
   database. There's a sample in that directory.  Name the first one
   of these files `csm-test-connection.properties` (more on that in a
   moment).
3) Run `buildr ctms-commons:suite:authorization:test:wipe_db` to
   initialize the schema.

You can keep several database configurations (e.g. for testing on
PostgreSQL vs. Oracle).  You can switch between them using the CSM_DB
environment variable:

    $ buildr ctms-commons:suite:authorization:test:wipe_db CSM_DB=csm-oracle
    $ buildr test CSM_DB=csm-oracle

This would look for the configuration in
`build/csm-oracle.properties`.  The default for CSM_DB is
`csm-test-connection`.

##### PostgreSQL

If you get an error like this:

    org.apache.tools.ant.BuildException: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: ERROR: language "plpgsql" does not exist
     Hint: Use CREATE LANGUAGE to load the language into the database.

Run this command as a database superuser in your PostgreSQL test
database:

    CREATE LANGUAGE plpgsql;

### Releasing

In order to release ctms-commons, you have to have been granted access
[per the BDA team's directions][bda-ivy].

#### Versions

ctms-commons tries to follow the rational versioning policy.  In
summary that means that the library version numbers go
[major].[minor].[patch]:

  * [patch] is updated for bugfixes only.
  * [minor] is updated for new features which do not break backwards
    compatibility.
  * [major] is updated for breaking changes.  This should be very rare.

An exception is where the [major] value is 0.  New modules in the
library can be initially released with major=0 while the API is being
hashed out.  Libraries with major=0 are expected to maintain backwards
compatibility only within minor versions (e.g., 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1).  Once
the API is firm, these modules should be released under the same
version scheme as the remainder of the library.

Going forward, ctms-commons will have many minor releases as an
alternative to publishing snapshot builds.

#### Steps to release

0) Ensure that everything you want to go into the release has been
   committed into trunk.  Ensure that the CHANGELOG is up to date.
1) Set the version number in the buildfile to the appropriate release
   version.  E.g., 3.9.4.RELEASE.
2) Commit.
3) Run `buildr publish:prepare`.  This will do a clean build, check
   out the CBIIT repo, and ready the ivy artifacts for publication.
4) Check that the new artifacts (under publish-repo) are as you expect.
5) Run `buildr publish:commit`.
6) Run `buildr publish:tag`.
7) Update the version number in the buildfile to the next development
   version.  E.g., 3.9.5.DEV.
8) Commit.

(Note that buildr provides a release process, but we aren't using it
because it doesn't support CBIIT's ivy repo setup.)
