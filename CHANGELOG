ctms-commons history
====================

1.0.2
-----

### all

- Allow suite:authorization integrated test database connection
  parameters to be specified using a properties file.

1.0.1
-----

### core

- Return build name as BuildInfo#toString.
- Treat OSGi-style .DEV revisions as snapshots in BuildInfo.

### all

- Updated ivy4r dependency to 0.11.0.
- Ensured that `buildr javadoc` can build combined javadoc for the
  whole project.
- Ensure that the project is built using Java 5's classfile format.

1.0.0
-----

### core

- Backwards-incompatible change:  introduce ConfigurationProperty and
  ConfigurationProperties interfaces.  The classes which had these names
  are now called DefaultConfigurationProperty and
  DefaultConfigurationProperties.
- Deprecated ...tools.spring.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.  The
  Spring 2.5+ version of this class provides equivalent functionality,
  so we don't need to maintain this fork any longer.  It will be
  removed in 1.1 or later.

### maven

- No projects use maven any longer, so all the maven mojos have been
  removed.  If you need one of the mojos, use the jar from an earlier
  ctms-commons release.

### testing

- Renamed modules "testing-all" to just "testing" and
  "testing-all:testing" to "testing:unit"

### acegi

- Upgraded to CSM 4.2.
- Removed DIAuthorizationDao because CSM 4.2 supports this on its own.
- Backwards-incompatible change: Moved all the acegi-* modules into
  CTMS-specific packages so as not to conflict with CSM.  Mapping:
    gov.nih.nci.security.acegi.* -> gov.nih.nci.cabig.ctms.acegi.*

### suite

- New module collection: suite.  Contains code that is specific to the
  Clinical Trials Suite and probably can't be used outside of the
  suite (or interacting with the suite).
- New module: authorization.  Contains common provisioning code (based
  on CSM) for the Clinical Trials Suite. (Still in prerelease 0.0.0
  versions.)

### all

- Begin formal changelog
- Convert from maven2 to buildr+ivy4r
- Switch to slf4j-api and away from commons-logging
