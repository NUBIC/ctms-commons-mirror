ctms-commons history
====================

1.1.0
-----

### all

- Update dev env to JRuby 1.6.2 and buildr 1.4.6.

- Replace Spring EBR dependencies with standard M2 versions. While I
  (RMS) am opposed to this, none of the other projects use OSGi
  (yet). Since PSC uses whitelisted dependencies anyway, it only
  benefits from ctms-commons using EBR deps insofar as it ensures that
  ctms-commons only uses EBR-available versions of things. The
  benefits to the other projects (which all use ivy's transitive
  dependency support) probably outweigh PSC's concern.

- Remove ctms-commons' copy of Spring's
  PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer. The feature that ctms-commons'
  version added is available in the built in one in Spring 2.5 and
  later. The ctms-commons version has been deprecated since at least
  ctms-commons 1.0.0.

- Update Spring dependency to 3.0.7.

1.0.9
-----

### all

- Improved the descriptive parts of the OSGi metadata for the modules which
  are OSGi bundles.

### web

- Modified WebTools#requestPropertiesToMap to suppress exceptions from
  property accessors.

1.0.8
-----

### core

- Include `catalina.base` on the search path for
  DataSourceSelfDiscoveringPropertiesFactoryBean.  This is more correct
  than `catalina.home`, but the latter is left for backwards compatibility.
  (In most cases they will be the same.)

1.0.7
-----

### suite-authorization

- Change SuiteRoleMembershipLoader#getProvisioningRoleMemberships to
  include scopeable memberships that have no study or site scopes.

1.0.6
-----

### lang

- Support constructor initialization in StaticNowFactory.

### suite-authorization

- Promote to released-module status (last pre-release was 0.5.0).  For
  earlier changes, see suite/authorization/CHANGELOG.prerelease.
- Add `SuiteRoleMembership#toString`.

1.0.5
-----

### core

- Add MoreRestrictions factory for Hibernate criteria.  First feature
  is a version of Hibernate's #in which automatically segments the
  value list for Oracle compatibility.

1.0.4
-----

### all

- Make all external imports optional in OSGi metadata.  This allows
  applications which use ctms-commons to pick-and-choose which
  features to use.

1.0.3
-----

### core

- Add tests for AuditUtil.
- Fix varargs problem in AuditUtil.getObjectId which caused it to
  never return an ID.

1.0.2
-----

### all

- Ensure that non-class resources are properly included in
  bnd-packaged jars.  This affected the web, laf, and
  suite:authorization modules.
- Allow suite:authorization integrated test database connection
  parameters to be specified using a properties file.

1.0.1
-----

### core

- Return build name as BuildInfo#toString.
- Treat OSGi-style .DEV revisions as snapshots in BuildInfo.

### all

- Updated ivy4r dependency to 0.11.0.
- Ensured that `buildr javadoc` can build combined javadoc for the
  whole project.
- Ensure that the project is built using Java 5's classfile format.

1.0.0
-----

### core

- Backwards-incompatible change:  introduce ConfigurationProperty and
  ConfigurationProperties interfaces.  The classes which had these names
  are now called DefaultConfigurationProperty and
  DefaultConfigurationProperties.
- Deprecated ...tools.spring.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.  The
  Spring 2.5+ version of this class provides equivalent functionality,
  so we don't need to maintain this fork any longer.  It will be
  removed in 1.1 or later.

### maven

- No projects use maven any longer, so all the maven mojos have been
  removed.  If you need one of the mojos, use the jar from an earlier
  ctms-commons release.

### testing

- Renamed modules "testing-all" to just "testing" and
  "testing-all:testing" to "testing:unit"

### acegi

- Upgraded to CSM 4.2.
- Removed DIAuthorizationDao because CSM 4.2 supports this on its own.
- Backwards-incompatible change: Moved all the acegi-* modules into
  CTMS-specific packages so as not to conflict with CSM.  Mapping:
    gov.nih.nci.security.acegi.* -> gov.nih.nci.cabig.ctms.acegi.*

### suite

- New module collection: suite.  Contains code that is specific to the
  Clinical Trials Suite and probably can't be used outside of the
  suite (or interacting with the suite).
- New module: authorization.  Contains common provisioning code (based
  on CSM) for the Clinical Trials Suite. (Still in prerelease 0.0.0
  versions.)

### all

- Begin formal changelog
- Convert from maven2 to buildr+ivy4r
- Switch to slf4j-api and away from commons-logging
